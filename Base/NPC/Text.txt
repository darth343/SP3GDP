1`0`1`Hello, I'm May. It has been a long time since we've got visitors. Nice to meet you!`1
1`0`1`The town was peaceful until monsters appeared out of nowhere. Most of the villagers left... The rest just stay in their houses..`2
1`0`1`Are you here to help us? Please stay safe!`3
2`0`2`Remember, "I" for inventory, "Z" to take care equipped monsters after capturing!~`1
2`0`2`If you need help again, just come back to me!`2
2`0`2`Byebye!`3
1`0`2`If you need help, you can approach my sister on the right side`1
1`0`2`Good luck!`2
3`2`2`Hello...`1
3`2`1`The teleporter below me can bring you onto the field... We created a barrier around town to keep us safe..`1
2`0`1`Let me give you some guidance...`1
2`0`1`Use "I" to open up your inventory.`2
2`0`1`The "Z" key is to take care of the monsters you have captured and equipped, if they are not happy, they won't help you!`3
2`0`1`After you capture a monster, you are able to ride your monster to your next destination, thus you can go on your journey!`4
2`0`1`Now you're ready to capture the monsters up top! Good luck!`5
2`0`3`I see you've captured a monster, well done!`1
1`0`3`Thank you for helping us!`1
1`0`3`Well, now you can choose to go through the portal or stay and grind for more weapons or armours!`2
3`0`3`Thank you very much...`1
